# AirBnB Clone - The ConsoleDescription 🏠
HolbertonBnB is a web application that replicates the functionality of AirBnB. Currently, it only includes the back-end console.
Console 💻

The console is a command line interpreter used to manage the backend of HolbertonBnB. It allows for handling and manipulation of all the classes used in the application through the storage object.

You can run the console in interactive or non-interactive mode. In non-interactive mode, you can pipe commands into the console.py file. For interactive mode, simply run the console.py file.

The console supports various commands such as creating new instances, displaying instance information, deleting instances, listing all instances, counting instances, and updating instance attributes.

To test the HolbertonBnB project, there are unit tests available in the tests folder. You can run the entire test suite or specify a specific test file to execute.
